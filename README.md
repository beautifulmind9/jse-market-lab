# JSE Market Lab

A decision-support analytics tool for evaluating short- to medium-term trading strategies and portfolio outcomes on the Jamaica Stock Exchange (JSE).

This project focuses on **decision intelligence under real-world constraints** — including liquidity, execution risk, trading costs, and incomplete data — rather than prediction or stock selection.

## What this project is
- A **decision-support tool**, not an education platform
- A **strategy analysis engine** for short- to medium-term trading
- A framework for evaluating:
  - signal quality
  - holding window behavior
  - net-of-cost performance
  - liquidity and execution risk
- A disciplined environment for testing **how strategies behave**, not what to buy

## What this project is not
- Not an investment advisory service
- Not a signal-selling product
- Not a price-tracking or alerting platform
- **Does not scrape or redistribute JSE exchange data**
- Does not provide buy/sell recommendations or guaranteed returns

## Data policy (important)
This repository operates using:
- **Bundled demo datasets** (limited, illustrative only)
- **User-provided datasets** that users lawfully obtain
- **Licensed datasets**, if and when applicable

No exchange-distributed raw datasets, live market feeds, or scraping logic are included in this public repository.

## Core principles
- Decision intelligence, not prediction
- Net-of-cost realism
- Liquidity and execution risk as first-class constraints
- Rule-based, explainable methodology
- User responsibility for final decisions
